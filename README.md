# Optimization-Saving-Potential-Prediction
This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict disposable income and potential savings based on personal finance factors.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:


Verify data consistency, particularly among income and spending columns.
Normalize or scale continuous features (e.g., income, rent, insurance) for model compatibility.
Encode categorical variables such as "Occupation" and "City_Tier" for machine learning models.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):


Visualize relationships between income, spending categories, and disposable income.
Analyze how factors like age, occupation, and city tier influence disposable income and savings potential.
Examine spending trends and saving potentials by spending categories (e.g., groceries, transport, entertainment).


Feature Engineering:


Create new features if necessary, such as percentage of income spent on each category or ratio of dependents to income.
Derive insights from spending patterns to enhance predictive power.


Model Development:


Separate the data into features and targets: use features to predict Disposable_Income and Potential Savings in key spending categories.
Train regression models (e.g., linear regression, random forest regressor) to predict both disposable income and individual savings potentials.
Evaluate the models using RMSE, MAE, or RÂ² metrics.


Model Evaluation:


Test model accuracy and ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
Fine-tune model parameters to improve performance.
